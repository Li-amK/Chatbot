# Description
In this repository you will find the Code to my Chatbots, developed in Python.
I'll explain the structure of this Repository later.

# Requirements
The Chatbots all rely on [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) and [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and if you wish to integrate with Discord also the [Discprd.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/) library. If you wish to tamper with my work in progress stuff, you will also need [Chatterbot](https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/).
See also [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Li-amK/Chatbot/blob/main/.github/requirements.txt).

# Structure
This Repository is split into two main Folders. **Chatbot** and **Chatbot x Discord**. 

## Chatbot
In the Chatbot Folder you will find the basic Chatbot Code LAIla runs on.
LAIla is the first form of Chatbot that I made and that works.

### Chatbot x Discord
I named the Chatbot KAI. The functionality is the same as with LAIla, except it's wrapped up as a Discord bot. To get the Bot running, I suggest you check the [Discprd.py Documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/) and the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
In short: Just paste your token into the Code, and you're good to go.

### Work in Progress
This Folder includes my messy development/work in progress. You have been warned. ~~And I apologize.~~ 

# Functionality
If you don't understand something, a search with the search engine of your choice might help, or check out the Discussions.
Feel free to open Issues if something doesn't work and to propose features in Discussions as well (Although I'm probably hell'a slow at implementing).

# License
I license this code under the MIT license. Please see the license file for more information. tl;dr you can do whatever you want as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the code or whatever you do with it.
