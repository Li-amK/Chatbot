# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for showing interest in my Chatbot Project.

These are not "official rules" per se, as I don't have any, but following them will help everyone deal with things in the most efficient manner.

# Issues

  * **Before submitting an Issue**
  
    Issues, bug reports and feature suggestions are welcomed, but please remember to search the Open Issues and Discussion section before submitting your own.
    The issue search box, as well as the issue tag system, are tools you can use to check if an issue similar to yours has been reported before.
    
  * **Bug Reports**
  
    Please try to include as much information and detail as you can when submitting a bug report, as it will make my life easier.
    
  * **Feauture Requests**
  
    When submitting a feature proposal, please describe it in the most understandable way you can.
    Communicating your idea for a feature can often be hard, and I would like to avoid any misunderstandings.
    As such, please try to explain your idea in a short, but understandable manner.
    
  * **Refrain from asking if an issue has been resolved yet**
  
    Please, just..., just don't.
